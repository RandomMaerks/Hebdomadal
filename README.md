# Hebdomadal

A result of trying to design something different every single week, for 52 full weeks of 2024: this conglomeration of a display typeface.

This typeface is a part of a design series I hosted on Instagram since the beginning of 2024, where I planned to design one or two different glyphs in a new style on every Sunday. The point was to have fun and possibly to discover how my creative brain works.

The font is free & open-source (although I may not accept contribution for this repo). If you are planning to show this typeface to someone or submit it to a font collection, do **link this repository**.
